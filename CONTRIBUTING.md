#Contributing Guidelines

##Issues

###Be mildly civil
Issue reports that start out by rudely throwing blame around are subject to closeure.

###Be clear and concise.
State what the issue is from a "whats wrong" prospective.
Bug reports should clearly allow maintainers to understand whats wrong and how to test/reproduce.

##PRs

###Hide something, get rejected.
Your PR should clearly state what it does. Adding unrelated things then never mentioning them will not fool us.
Breaking this rule too many times will lead to a block.
Breaking this rule to add something that compromises the security of this application will lead to a block and report to github and/or the proper authorities.
